          <p>Hie. You must be new here. Welcome. No, don’t worry about introducing yourself. 
              Everyone here knows your story, has lived your story. You probably read the entire 
              Harry Potter/Percy Jackson/Chronicles of Narnia collection in under a week and were 
              on a first-name basis with the local librarian who fuelled your steadily growing 
              addiction to books that were way above your reading level. The other kids probably 
              made fun of you and called you names but whose name was called out every Prize Giving 
              Day? That’s right, yours! You have a box somewhere in your house, or a drawer, or maybe 
              even a shelf where all your medals and trophies and certificates gather dust when they’re 
              not being paraded in front of relatives and visitors. No one cares that you won a chess 
              tournament when you were in Form One or that you had the highest Biology End of Year marks 
              five years ago. No, that’s not entirely true. You care. And it kills you that no one else 
              seems to.</p>
          <p>You’d never call yourself a gifted child, especially not in public, but I mean, if the shoe fits… 
              No need to be modest here, it’s a safe space. Your grades were objectively good, no doubt about it. 
              And everyone here knows that for the most part, you were cruising by on the bare minimum.  You shone, 
              and you did it effortlessly. Then you got to high school and met so many other stars that your light 
              began to slowly dim. Now you actually had to study for a test. And take notes in class, even if you 
              weren’t going to read them. And somehow find a way to balance school with leadership responsibilities 
              because we all know Zimbabwean schools tend to equate academic competency with leadership abilities.
               Pretty soon, all these things became intricately tied to your identity and your sense of self-worth. 
               You probably did not even realize it at the time because you were riding the sweet wave of that high 
               school peak. Maybe you’re still on that wave, blissfully ignorant of what will happen when it finally crashes.
          </p>
          <p>University will come, if it hasn’t already, and teach you that being invisible isn’t a superpower. Suddenly, you’re
            one of many national award-winning geniuses and all the pins and badges you wore on your high school blazer are as 
               insignificant as you feel. Nothing could have prepared you for how overwhelming being ordinary is. You did a great 
               job setting the incredibly high standards that you did but they’re getting harder and harder to maintain. You try to
                raise really well-crafted arguments in class but it’s not enough to make waves; your lecturers don’t know you by name 
                nor do they ever admonish your classmates to be more like you. You’re studying twice as hard but getting half the grades 
                you used to. Your parents either act like it isn’t all that big a deal or they completely flip out. Either way, you’re 
                pushing yourself to the limit and burning the candle at both ends because it is inconceivable to you that you have any 
                worth outside of your academic achievements, which are severely lacking at this point. When nothing changes, you become 
                apathetic about your downward spiral into the dark abyss of failure. Imposter syndrome keeps you company on the way down. 
                You start to question the nature of your reality and the answer to questions like, “Was I ever really that good in the first 
                place?” is always a resounding and merciless no. Cue the mental health breakdown we could all smell coming from a mile away.</p>
          <p>It sounds familiar, doesn’t it? Maybe not all of it, but bits and pieces here and there resonated, right? You wouldn’t be here, 
              sitting in this room with us, if you weren’t as tired and burnt out as the rest of us. Now, we can tell you our stories of how 
              we overcame or how we recovered or however else you want to phrase it, but you’re smart enough to know the old adage about horses 
              and drinking water. The journey will not be linear. If anything, it’s more like a badly drawn squiggly circle that seems impossible 
              to navigate. But that’s what the support group is for. So, if you’re interested, you can keep coming to our weekly meetings, and 
              let’s see if we can’t help turn you back into a well-adjusted human being again… </p>
