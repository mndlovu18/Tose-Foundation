        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
          <p>In Zimbabwe, I did four years of O’Level at a government high 
            school before moving to a private one for two years of A’Level. One stark difference I 
            noticed upon my transition from Roosevelt to Arundel was the smaller students to teacher 
            ratio. At Roosevelt, we would be roughly 45 students in a class while O’level students 
            at Arundel would not exceed 20 in one class, and 10 for A’level classes. Upon reflection, 
            I appreciate the joys of learning with such great diversity of minds in one classroom but 
            wish I had more time to engage deeply with my peers on class material and establish helpful 
            relationships with my teachers - a privilege I was fortunate to experience at Arundel owing 
            to the smaller student-teacher ratio.</p>
          <p>Arundel implemented the “Office Hours” system where students were 
            welcome to consult teachers on difficult class material during certain hours of the day. This 
            setup formed an integral part of my success at Arundel as I could easily walk in for Office Hours 
            and get help. While teachers at Roosevelt were generally available, the lack of a formal structure 
            for student consultation sometimes made it a hussle to access help. 
          </p>
          <p>During my time at Roosevelt, personal laptops were prohibited and the only 
            computer lab available, with about 10 to 15 monitors, was not easily accessible. None of my classes 
            required Powerpoint presentations nor encouraged the development of technological skills. In contrast, 
            Form 1s up to Sixth Form at Arundel were allowed chromebooks and laptops respectively, and some classes 
            assigned tasks which were to be presented as Powerpoints - an exercise that really sharpened my technological 
            creativity as well as opened my mind to the different ways I could leverage technology to enhance my learning 
            experience. In addition to this, for classes like Chemistry and Biology, we rarely performed experiments at 
            Roosevelt due to lack of adequate resources like apparatus and chemical solutions while weekly experiments were 
            conducted at Arundel, with every student allocated the necessary equipment for individual use.</p>
          <p>Career education is also an indispensable aspect of my Arundel education. The afternoons 
            and, sometimes, evenings spent at college fairs and career advising sessions proved to be remarkably useful when time 
            came for me to apply to college. Not only did I have a sense of where I wanted to go, I also knew how to get there and 
            some of the studying options I could explore. I felt prepared for college leaving Arundel than I would have been had 
            I left from Roosevelt given the latter’s lack of a set career advising structure.</p>
